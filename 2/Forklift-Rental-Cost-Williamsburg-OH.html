<p>The load of the forks must be balanced by the weight of the lift truck in order for this principle to work. These are Class 5 forklifts. A reach fork truck is primarily an indoor forklift most useful for reaching high racks. It can be used in all types of workplaces where efficient material handling is desired. If you are looking for a second hand forklift for sale, then this is the ideal site to help you.</p>
<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>

Through our connections and many resources, we are always adding units to our inventory, giving you a wide selection of makes and models to suit the needs of your operation.
