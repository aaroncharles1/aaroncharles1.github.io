A forklift truck is designed with protected cab for a driver and two prongs on the front to move and carry heavy loads around your factory or warehouse. The reason that these trucks are ideally suited for off road driving is that the body of the truck is protected by the fact that it's several feet away from the ground, meaning that it's less likely to come into collision with the ground or other objects on the ground.</p>

The 35 Logistics counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver. Counterbalance and reach forklifts are two commonly used types of truck throughout a variety of industries. This can get a bit tricky and technical, so always make sure you have a licensed mechanic install this type of lift kit to ensure that the suspension still works afterward.</p>
<p>These types of powered industrial trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and have pneumatic (air filled) tires. Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
