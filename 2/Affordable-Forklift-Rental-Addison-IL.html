It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>

Like class 1 forklifts, class 2s are also battery-powered and are more optimally used within a warehouse rather than out in the shipping yard.</p>
<p>22. 22 Performance-Oriented Requirements ï‚§ The powered industrial truck operator training requirements are performance-oriented to permit employers to tailor a training program to the characteristics of their workplaces and the particular types of powered industrial trucks operated. Forklift rental and lease companies may have used forklifts for sale. According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the counterbalance load distribution are involved in falling load accidents more frequently than other types of powered industrial trucks.</p>

The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>

A pallet jack, also known as a pallet truck, 1 pallet pump, pump truck, scooter, dog, 1 or jigger 1 is a tool used to lift and move pallets Pallet jacks are the most basic form of a forklift 2 and are intended to move pallets within a warehouse.</p>
<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up. In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
