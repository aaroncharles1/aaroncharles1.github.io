Able to lift up to 8 t, these forklifts are rugged and suited for outdoor applications. Beginning mechanics may be surprised by the complexity of lifting a truck, particularly if the added height exceeds three inches.</p>
<p>If your warehouse is stocked full of pallets, a warehouse forklift is an efficient way to carefully load and remove balanced inventory from industrial shelving. Visit your local big-box superstore like Costco's, Sam's Club, Lowe's or Home Depot, and it's hard not to notice all those forklifts.
