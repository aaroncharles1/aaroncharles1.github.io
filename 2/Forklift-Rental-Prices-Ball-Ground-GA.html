<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture. One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced — meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability. Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>

As order pickers are mostly operated at elevated heights, it is important that operators are properly trained on maneuvering and safety of these trucks.</p>
<p>Learned a lot about safety, always look at your surroundings, the max weight limit, maintenance on the forklift, center of gravity and so on. A hydraulic hand pump is powered by manual movement and meant for projects requiring portability. The "HD" in name on many of these trucks stands for "heavy duty" which is expertly brought out in full force thanks to these lifts and customizations as well as their trim levels and available engines.</p>
