Not move the truck and remain at the controls at all times, if operating an industrial lift truck with a forklift platform with an employee on the platform.

This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck.

<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company. PLS Kits are available for most of the popular vehicle applications and can be completely removed if necessary. The point of these vehicles seems mostly to project an obnoxiously aggressive attitude over all other drivers. If you're passionate about off-roading , then lifting your truck is a great choice.</p>
<p>A lifted truck, often referred to as a 4x4 truck, is a modified vehicle specially designed for off road driving and other types of high-impact work. At a minimum, you should have a card or certificate of proof of training and the vehicle load charts (and attachment load charts as well, if applicable) on the jobsite—OSHA will look for these items first.
