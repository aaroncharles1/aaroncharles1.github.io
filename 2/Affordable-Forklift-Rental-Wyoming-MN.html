<p>Scenario: You're in the market for a new forklift in Indianapolis You know specifically that you need an electric lift truck with cushion tires that can lift loads up to 4,500 lbs. With the innovative infrastructural unit, we are offering an inclusive assortment of High Lift Pallet Truck. Piggyback lifts - They are designed to lock on the back of delivery trucks for easy transportation to work sites as well as the smooth offloading of products. Novice training - This is for those who have no prior knowledge operating forklift trucks. To make sure that this is met even in confined spaces, Linde designed the reach trucks for optimum visibility and fitted them with appropriate equipment.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>

The dual tires in the rear are as wide as the truck itself, and almost completely outboard of the body, so essentially it's like three trucks wide and three trucks tall coming at you. The optional light and fan package offers enhanced lighting on the operator's platform, allowing enhanced visibility when order picking.</p>
