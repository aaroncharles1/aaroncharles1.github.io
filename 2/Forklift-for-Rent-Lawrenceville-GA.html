<p>As a legacy global provider of forklift trucks, we have in-depth knowledge of the industry and are able to offer a level of support that is unmatched in today's marketplace. Air Lift on-board air compressor systems will let you inflate and deflate your air springs from inside your cab or outside your vehicle. Therefore, tires that rub at stock height will still rub with a torsion twist somewhere in the suspension travel.</p>

OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
