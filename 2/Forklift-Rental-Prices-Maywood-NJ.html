<h3>Used Forklift Price Maywood NJ</h3>

Their upfront price is the inverse of electric, making IC forklifts initially cheaper than electric models, but they cost more per hour to run. At Durante Rentals, we rent forklifts and telehandlers for all your material handling needs.</p>
<p>Given their job description and different types of conditions to deal with, order pickers need to be OSHA compliant with their training.
