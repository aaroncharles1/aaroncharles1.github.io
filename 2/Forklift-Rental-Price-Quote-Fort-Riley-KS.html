<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>

Another subtype of warehouse forklift, the counterbalance forklift, looks like a standard warehouse forklift—except it has no extending arms for the forward forks and the back is weighted to counterbalance the load. Another major reason why accidents occur is due to improper loading and unloading of the forklift.</p>
