<p>It is imperative that you make a good sound and informed decision to ensure that you purchase the right forklift for the job within your desired budget. However, lifting provides many advantages for off-road use, including greater approach, breakover, and departure angles. Counterbalance forklifts have no extending arms, giving them the ability to move directly to the load.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>
