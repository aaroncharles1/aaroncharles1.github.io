Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load.

Designed to work specifically indoors in tight access environments like high density warehousing, standup forklifts offer a number of efficiency enhancing features that are not available on the "general use" standard sit-down forklift.</p>
