<p>BVA offers a wide range of industrial products to suit any industry including construction, mining, oil, forestry, foundation repair, MRO, OEMs and more. The dashboards of forklifts today use computers.

Contact BigRentz at (888) 325-5172 to find the right rough terrain forklift for your job site.</p>

<p>With high ground clearance and durable super-elastic wheels, these forklifts are ideal for working in indoor and outdoor environments. Rough terrain forklifts have the build and rugged construction to handle tough outdoor work. Due to their variety in fueling, size and either a four or three wheel design, counterbalance forklifts are arguably the more versatile of the two trucks.</p>
<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability. The Hydraulic hand Pallet trucks can handle palletised load up to 2500 Kg in a single haul and a single operator can lift and move this weight effortlessly over short distances.</p>
