These hand pallet trucks are equipped with a weight indicator or scale, which allows you to easily weigh loads during transport for maximum efficiency. Designed for light, medium and heavy-duty material handling, our internal combustion (IC) counterbalanced trucks are equipped with the unique Toyota System of Active Stability (Toyota SAS) to enhance operator safety and comfort.</p>
<p>For others, it's the enhanced functionality and driver satisfaction that makes these trucks attractive choice.
