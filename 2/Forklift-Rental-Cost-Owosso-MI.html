We are a full-service forklift and material handling equipment dealer, proudly located in Phoenix and serving the great state of Arizona.

If you are not sure how everything works in a lifted truck that you want to test drive, ask questions. Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>
