Manufacturing, wholesaling and trading of supreme quality Hand Pallet Truck has helped us achieve a very high level of trust in the market.</p>
<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet. As already mentioned, choosing a forklift with the right handling capacity is therefore essential. Forklifts come in a variety of shapes and sizes to do various jobs. You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>

Powered by a lithium-ion battery, this electric pallet truck offers up to 3 hours of use. Depending on the quality of your shocks, you'll likely enjoy more control of your vehicle and higher ground clearance as well. We will focus on how to maintain your forklift's stability and handling, as well as how to lift loads properly.</p>
<p>While many people do lift their trucks strictly for appearance's sake, the main reason to do it is to increase ground clearance and to get the body, frame, and differentials higher.
