A significant portion of my business deals with forklift operator training (or more precisely, powered industrial truck operator training).</p>

Many of our long-term customers had their first exposure to the fuel efficiency, high productivity and ease of operation of Linde forklifts through their dealings with our forklift hire department. They are also ideal machines for loading trucks, as only the forks stick out in front.</p>

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>

We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>

A person must learn how to drive a forklift while carrying a payload.</p>
