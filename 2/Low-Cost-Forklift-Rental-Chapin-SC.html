<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can.

If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
