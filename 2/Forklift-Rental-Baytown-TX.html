<p>Aside from these two distinct types of a forklift, there are many other varieties available. Reach forklifts, also known as reach trucks, get their names from the distinctive way in which their fork carriages can ‘reach' into racking. Low noise and vibration, excellent all-round visibility and easy servicing allow for improved driver comfort and forklift truck durability.</p>
<p>Imagine the devastation of crashing with a semi-truck - that's the kind of damage you can expect from a lifted vehicle. Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
