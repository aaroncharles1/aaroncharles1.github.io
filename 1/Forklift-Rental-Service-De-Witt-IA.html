<p>For the development of modern Forklift Trucks, Hyster-Yale Materials plays a major role in bringing the connected device technology across the trucking industry. Some forklifts use a single hydraulic cylinder to elevate the boom, while others use two cylinders. While moving palletized loads is fastest and easiest, these machines can load and unload a variety of objects.</p>

Including heavy-duty shop presses, steel lever bars, pole jacks, reel jacks, screw jacks, and several types of ratchet jacks, we offer a full line of mechanical jacks capable of lifting up to 75 tons. The biggest draw of sit-down forklifts is also the most obvious one: operators get to sit down.</p>
