<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>

Our complete material handling products line can help make your warehouse or factory become more efficiently designed for maximum productivity. We have hundreds of used forklifts for sale.
