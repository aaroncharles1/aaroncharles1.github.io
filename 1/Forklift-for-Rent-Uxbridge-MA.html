Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines.

Our complete material handling products line can help make your warehouse or factory become more efficiently designed for maximum productivity. We have hundreds of used forklifts for sale.
