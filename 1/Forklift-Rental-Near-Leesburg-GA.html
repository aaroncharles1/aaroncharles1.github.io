<h3>Lifting And Material Handling Leesburg GA 31763</h3>
<p>Supporting a forklift platform is operated on a firm flat surface. If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast.

<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
