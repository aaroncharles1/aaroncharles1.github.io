<p>Licensing prerequisites are the same for both conventional and rough terrain forklifts.

<p>Learned a lot about safety, always look at your surroundings, the max weight limit, maintenance on the forklift, center of gravity and so on. A hydraulic hand pump is powered by manual movement and meant for projects requiring portability.
