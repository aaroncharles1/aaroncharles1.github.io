<p>Licensing prerequisites are the same for both conventional and rough terrain forklifts.

<p>Learned a lot about safety, always look at your surroundings, the max weight limit, maintenance on the forklift, center of gravity and so on. A hydraulic hand pump is powered by manual movement and meant for projects requiring portability. The "HD" in name on many of these trucks stands for "heavy duty" which is expertly brought out in full force thanks to these lifts and customizations as well as their trim levels and available engines.</p>
