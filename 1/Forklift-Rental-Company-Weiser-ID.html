<p>A subtype of the warehouse forklift, side loaders are usually found in steel service centers and manufacturing facilities with heavy and bulky items. Ensure that loads on pallets are stable, neat, cross-tied if possible, and evenly distributed. A reach truck looks like a very small type of counterbalance forklift.

<p>Longer term rental equipment is better addressed with a charger that will need to be wired in at your site by a licensed electrician.

We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>

Lifted trucks with a body lift have physical spacers or blocks installed between the body and the frame of the truck.</p>

<p>The 12,000 lb. electric is built on a larger frame than the 8,000 to 10,000 lb. trucks. Though pallet jacks are indeed very handy equipment to have around the warehouse, it's important to ensure that workers know how to operate them safely. The higher ground clearance will help your truck handle different types of road conditions.
