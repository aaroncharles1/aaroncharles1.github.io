A lifted suspension, though it's protected from scraping over rocks and debris, responds differently to this stress; if you lift your Jeep's suspension, your standard shocks might not do the trick.

Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
