This amount also plays a key factor in the vehicle's stability — a forklift that carries too much weight isn't stable.

Likewise, in current scenarios, the diesel forklift trucks are estimated to have an exponential growth rate over the forecast period ranging from the most simple to the advance manufactured Forklift Trucks that includes electronically controlled engines and GPS communication systems.</p>

<p>There are also variants that features a stand-up forklift, which makes it easier for operators to hop on and off between loads. The user should mark, on the sides of the truck, in letters at least 1½ in. high, the actual vehicle weight, the maximum load and the combined weight of the vehicle and capacity load.
