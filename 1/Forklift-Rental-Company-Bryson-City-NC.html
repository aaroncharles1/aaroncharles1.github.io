Ohio Power Tool carries a vast selection of pumps - including dewatering, diaphragm, sewage, sump, and trash varieties - from top names in tool manufacturing ( Chicago Pneumatic , Greenlee , Multiquip , RIDGID , and Wheeler-Rex ). These water pumps also offer a few power options (air, electric, gas, hydraulic) with some even being submersible.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
