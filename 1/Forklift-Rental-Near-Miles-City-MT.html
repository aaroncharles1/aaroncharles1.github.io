Rough terrain forklifts, often known as telehandlers, are engineered for operation on some of the most extreme terrain and climatic conditions. You may have to pay a premium on the maintenance and gas mileage of a lifted truck, but there are ways to save money on the purchase of lifted trucks.</p>
<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components. Where typical fork lift trucks need to approach a load head on, on a flat even surface, an all-terrain or rough terrain forklift can pick up a load even when the load is on a slope or otherwise unusually positioned.</p>

<p>Electric forklifts don't generate polluting emissions, and although they are usually the most expensive to buy, they are the cheapest in terms of operating costs. All operators are required to wear a harness while operating any order picker at any height. Heli is China's number one manufacturer of forklifts and 6th largest in the world.
