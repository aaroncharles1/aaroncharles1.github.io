Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers.

<p>If your service crew is already busy with the rest of your equipment, don't load them up with even more equipment to maintain. The lift truck market value and volume are contributed by the revenue and the forklift truck units sold across North America, Asia Pacific, Middle-East Africa and Latin America. If you're working outdoors, a gas forklift may make sense, but the introduction of the electric forklift has fundamentally changed warehouse usage.</p>
<p>Before settling on what forklift to purchase or rent, be certain you've got a good idea of the weights and dimensions of the loads you intend to lift. Its optimized design and quiet, stable mast allows for precise control of loads of all shapes and sizes, especially when used with a variety of attachments. OSHA tests you on properly driving forklifts. Product-line features: Each of the JCB rough-terrain forklifts is powered by a four-cylinder diesel engine generating 76 horsepower, driven for quick, smooth operation in all terrain by a JCB SyncroShuttle transmission.</p>
