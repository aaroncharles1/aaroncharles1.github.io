<p>It comprises all types of electric pallet trucks, forklift trucks, order pickers, reach trucks, tow tractors, tow train trailers and shuttle vehicles. An electric pallet jack is a pallet jack powered by batteries contained inside the pallet jack. All pedestrian operated trucks have forks that slide beneath the pallet and use a hydraulic jack to lift the load from the ground for easy manoeuvrability.</p>
<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg). It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
