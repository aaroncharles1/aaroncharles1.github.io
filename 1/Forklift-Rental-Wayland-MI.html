<p>Powered industrial trucks, commonly called forklifts or lift trucks, are used in many industries, primarily to move materials.

Designed by CASE, Load Control automatically provides on-the-go mast cushioning that lessens load shock when traveling over uneven terrain. A big lifted truck looks rugged and will surely turn some heads, but there are good practical applications to lifting truck aside from making it look good.</p>
