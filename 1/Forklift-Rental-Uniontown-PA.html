<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Used for handling large amount of materials, this product is designed with a high level of precision at par with international quality parameters. Whatever materials handling task you need fulfilling, Cat Lift Trucks offer you one of the most dependable and complete counterbalance forklifts in the industry. The most notable feature of the rough terrain forklift is the oversized, aggressive treaded tires.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

<p>We stock all forklift classes from electric, propane, and high capacity diesel for your immediate rentals needs. Don't expect a forklift to handle like a car or truck. The side-shift is a key forklift feature that will facilitate you to move any load left or right without needing to move the truck, facilitating to place loads more accurately. The first step toward buying the pre-designed lifted truck for you is to determine exactly what it is you're looking for in a vehicle of this type.</p>
<p>The G2 features a 4 inch elevated off road suspension lift, custom G2 wheels, and 33 inch all-terrain tires. Included in this class are lift trucks with 3 or 4 wheels and either cushion (solid) or pneumatic (air filled) tires. Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>
