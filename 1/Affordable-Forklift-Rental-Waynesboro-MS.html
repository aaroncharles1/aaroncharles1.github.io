There will be a gap between the body and the frame of the truck, which can be covered with a gap guard to protect the exposed mechanicals.Suspension lifts are used to get that super-mega-monster truck look.</p>

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable.
