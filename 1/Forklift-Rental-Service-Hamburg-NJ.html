We have new and used forklifts for sale and as rentals.</p>
<p>First forklifts appeared already in the early 20th century, and were used in World War II. Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors. One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking.

<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail.

<p>Towing: It's easier to tow heavier loads with a lifted truck since your truck won't be as at high of risk of bottoming out. If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. From lifting items into the shipping trucks to stocking things away in storage, their maneuverability lends well to various working environments and conditions.</p>
<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up. To get around this issue, the counterbalanced stacker has a longer chassis to increase leverage. Forklifts are responsible for only 1% of all warehouse or factory accidents. Our experienced service technicians are ready and able to repair all makes and models of forklifts.</p>
