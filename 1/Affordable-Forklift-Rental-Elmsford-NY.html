<p>This Nationally Recognised and WorkSafe Victoria Accredited Unit allows you to perform work that requires a forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence. Carefully consider lifting a brand new truck, as this can cause premature wear and added stress to critical components such as shocks, wheel bearings, suspension bushings, ball joints, and tie rods. When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>

<p>As a legacy global provider of forklift trucks, we have in-depth knowledge of the industry and are able to offer a level of support that is unmatched in today's marketplace. Air Lift on-board air compressor systems will let you inflate and deflate your air springs from inside your cab or outside your vehicle. Therefore, tires that rub at stock height will still rub with a torsion twist somewhere in the suspension travel.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
